# Deploy a pre-built agent (opencode or claude-code-validator) onto the attendee's
# S3 Files mount.
#
# Normally the workshop stack already built this agent's arm64 image at bootstrap
# (the slow, mount-independent work), so this script just runs the agent's
# deploy.py: CreateAgentRuntime attaching the S3 Files access point the attendee
# created on Stage 1 page 1. Fast, image in ECR.
#
# But the pre-build is best-effort and NOT guaranteed on every account. To keep ONE
# command working everywhere (the governing test), this script self-heals: if the
# image was not pre-built, it runs the agent's setup.sh first (build + push), then
# deploy.py. Both opencode and the Claude Code validator are Bedrock-native, so
# there is no vendor key to provision.
#
# The kiro/codex targets are kept as hidden/legacy restore paths (both were retired
# from the served roster): kiro's build works WITHOUT a key via --skip-identity.
#
# Usage (from coding-agents):
#   ./deploy-prebuilt.sh opencode
#   ./deploy-prebuilt.sh claude-code-validator       # the validator (Bedrock-native, no key)
#   ./deploy-prebuilt.sh kiro                        # hidden/legacy: builds --skip-identity if not pre-built
