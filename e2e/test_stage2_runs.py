"""Stage 2. Orchestrate (autonomous): run lifecycle + compose + acceptance gate.

The workshop step this file covers: an attendee opens the Stage 2 chat surface,
submits ONE task, and watches the orchestrator ROUTE it, run the five-phase
blueprint fire-and-forget, prove the deterministic pytest acceptance gate in a
SEPARATE review pen, compose the routed roles' artifacts into one deliverable, and
(real-or-null) open a PR. There is NO race and NO winner; the routed roles compose
into a single result, and only routed roles get a terminal pane.

Every test drives the same console server over the same-origin `/api/orchestrator/...`
mounts an attendee's browser hits, behind the same cookie wall. Local engine mode
is pinned in conftest (deterministic, no model), so "done" is the same pytest gate
the workshop grades with and a convert task reaches "passed". Polls are bounded by
the shared `poll_route`/`poll_terminal` helpers.

If a test here breaks, a non-negotiable has regressed: routed dispatch (not fixed
fan-out), the separate review gate, the exact LGTM token, real-or-null PR (never a
fake URL), routed-roles-only terminals, or honest local-zero usage.
