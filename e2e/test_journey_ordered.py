"""The whole 4-hour journey, in ORDER, as ONE attendee walks it, every content step.

Unlike the per-stage modules (each test independent), THIS file is the SPINE: one
ordered narrative where each `test_NN_*` is a single checkpoint in the EXACT step
sequence the content teaches, and later checkpoints depend on the artifacts earlier
ones produced. pytest runs tests in file-definition order, so reading `pytest -v`
top-to-bottom IS the run sheet:

  Login → Stage 1 (deploy claude-code → open session+shell → the workspace is EMPTY,
  so the attendee CREATES cost_analyzer.py themselves in the explorer (New File →
  paste → Save), then a second file too → `agentcore deploy` in the terminal,
  smart-capture onto the shelf → edit the subagent name+purpose → scaffold the harness
  → convert the module, verified, 140.16 → verify over the wire → deploy-upload the
  bundle) → Stage 2 (submit the
  convert task → route is convert/all-three → the run reaches `passed` with the LGTM
  token) → Stage 3 (the dashboard reflects the run → cost-breakdown by user attributes
  it → p95 is a number) → cleanup.

State threads through one module-level `STATE` dict (the session id, the deployed
agent, the run id). If a checkpoint here breaks, a content page is telling attendees
to do something that no longer works in order.

Local engine mode (deterministic, no model). Drives the SAME real server the rest of
the e2e suite shares via conftest; these tests DO NOT boot their own server.
