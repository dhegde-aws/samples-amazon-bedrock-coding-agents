"""Dispatch a role to its coding-agent deployed on AgentCore Runtime.

This is the shipped, real-only producer: it runs a role's coding-agent CLI INSIDE
the role's deployed AgentCore Runtime container, over the AgentCore command shell
(``AgentCoreRuntimeClient.open_shell`` → ``ShellSession``). There is no in-process
CLI runner on the shipped path; a role's CLI only ever runs in its deployed
Runtime, never on the orchestrator box:

  1. open a WebSocket shell on the role's runtime (SigV4, the server-side path);
  2. ``cd`` into the run's workspace on the shared ``/mnt/s3files`` mount and run
     the agent's launcher (``/app/run.sh --print '<prompt>'``) headless, with the
     Bedrock env set inline;
  3. capture only STDOUT, delimited by sentinels so the prompt echo and ANSI
     noise never pollute the transcript or the artifact;
  4. read the artifact the CLI wrote (``cat`` over the same shell; S3Files is a
     managed filesystem, not a transparent ``s3://`` prefix, so the file is read
     back through the runtime, never via ``s3:GetObject``).

The role prompts are identical to the in-process path; only WHERE the CLI runs
changes. A missing runtime, a nonzero exit, or a missing/empty artifact raises
``RoleExecutionError``; the run fails loud, it never degrades to a local build.

Why a sync wrapper around an async SDK: the engine drives roles on worker
threads. ``run_in_runtime`` owns its own event loop per call (``asyncio.run`` in
a private thread is unsafe to nest, so we run the coroutine on a fresh loop),
keeping the engine's threading model unchanged.

      * LIVE PTY (preferred when the console hosts one): the dispatch drives the
        agent's real interactive TUI -- the same WebSocket shell session the
        Agents page streams -- so the human, the orchestrator, and the run view
        all watch ONE live session (server fan-out), and the human can type into
        it before and after the turn.
      * HEADLESS one-shot (always available): a fresh command shell runs the CLI
        ``--print``-style. This is the path when no console PTY exists (CLI-only
        submit, coordinator deployed without the console) and the safety net if
        the live surface cannot host this dispatch.

    Raises ``RoleExecutionError`` on a nonzero exit or a missing/empty artifact:
    the same fail-loud contract the engine's ``_read_artifact`` enforced locally.

    SAME-PROVIDER RESILIENCE (legacy, now dormant): an OpenAI-on-Bedrock model
    could be de-registered or have a transient outage, surfaced as a nonzero exit
    with a model-down signature. ``llm.openai_sibling`` returns a healthy sibling
    ONLY for an ``openai.*`` model id, so this retry fires only for that provider.
    The frontend role now runs opencode on a Bedrock Claude model, so
    ``openai_sibling`` returns None and this block is a no-op for it; it stays in
    place for any future ``openai.*`` dispatch and is harmless otherwise.

    TESTING SEAM: when ``runtime_arn`` is a local dev URI (``http(s)://…``, what
    ``agentcore dev`` serves), dispatch over HTTP to its ``/invocations`` instead
    of the command shell, so the orchestrator can be exercised end to end against
    a locally-running role WITHOUT a deployed runtime. This is the ONLY non-shell
    producer and it is gated strictly on the URI shape (never reachable for a real
