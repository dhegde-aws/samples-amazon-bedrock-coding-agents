"""Harness-steering tests: the three role files turned green as you write them.

Stage 2 has attendees fill in three steering files, one per role, each with a
fenced ``harness:<kind>`` block the engine reads to compose deterministically:

  * page 2  claude-code/CLAUDE.md          ``harness:build``  (server_name/version/expose)
  * page 3  opencode/AGENTS.md                ``harness:ui``     (title/tool/.../examples)
  * page 4  kiro/.kiro/steering/validator  ``harness:gate``   (contract/checks/max_iterations)

This is the red→green checkpoint for those three writes, and the answer-key guard
that the content's blocks match what the engine parses. It needs no model and no
server: each case reads the file the attendee edits and asserts the parsed spec.

    python3 -m pytest orchestrator/test_builders.py -v

The stub files ship with empty/TODO blocks, so before you fill them in these cases
fail (the parser falls back to defaults and the raw block carries no keys). When the
three blocks match the values the pages give you, every case is green.
