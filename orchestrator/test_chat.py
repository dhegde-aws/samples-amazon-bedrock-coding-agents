"""Tests for the orchestrator brain (chat.py): the chatbot the console drives.

These pin the seams the console depends on WITHOUT a model call: the tool set,
the dynamic model catalog, the multimodal prompt builder (a pasted image becomes
real image content blocks, not base64 text), and the non-blocking dispatch tools
that kick a real run on an injected fixture engine. The streaming loop itself
(which calls Bedrock) is exercised live + by the console smoke tests.
