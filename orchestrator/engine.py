"""The embedded orchestration engine: routed, reviewed, and terminal-transparent.

Production orchestrators implement this as a durable function (checkpoint/replay,
suspension, condition-based polling). This module is the same design, embedded:
one in-process engine that drives every task through the same deterministic state
machine. It is real-only: each role's artifact is produced by dispatching that role
to its DEPLOYED AgentCore Runtime. There is no local, in-process, or model-in-process
producer on the shipped path, and a missing wired runtime fails loud rather than
silently building locally. The producer sits behind the execution seam
(``executor.Executor``): ``AgentCoreExecutor`` (the shipped default,
``InvokeAgentRuntime`` / command-shell dispatch against deployed role runtimes).

Three design decisions define this engine:

  * **Model-selected tools with a deterministic floor.** ``chat.py`` lets the
    Strands coordinator clarify an ambiguous request and choose dispatch tools.
    ``router.py`` provides the versioned registry and advisory route ladder used
    by ``run_build``. Only selected roles are dispatched.
  * **A separate reviewer whose verdict lands on the PR** (``reviewer.py``). The build
    side never approves its own work: finalization runs the validator-authored
    acceptance test (a real execution, real exit code), opens or updates the pull
    request, and the judge posts an Assessment comment ON that PR: approve
    (closing with the exact pass token ``LGTM: no changes needed``) or request
    changes, which loops the routed roles through one bounded re-implement pass
    that updates the same PR.
  * **A real PR at the end** (``github.py``). When the attendee connects GitHub,
    the composed run branch is pushed to their fork and the PR opens with the
    critique report. Without credentials the PR field carries a typed error and
    ``pr_url`` stays null. A local diagnostic branch is never presented as a PR.

Every role works in its own container directory and leaves a TERMINAL TRANSCRIPT:
``/bin/sh`` commands with their output (installing its harness by writing the
steering file, probing the module, booting the server, running the gate), plus, on
the dispatched role, the live CLI session that ran INSIDE the deployed Runtime,
read back over the command shell. The console streams these transcripts into
per-role xterm panes: what you watch is what ran.

How a role's artifact is produced (the step behind the execution seam):

  * **AgentCore Runtime (shipped, real-only)**: each role's coding-agent CLI runs
    INSIDE its deployed Runtime: Claude Code (``claude``) writes ``mcp_server.py``,
    opencode (``opencode``) writes ``chatbot.html``, and the Claude Code validator
    (``claude``) writes the validation report. The engine dispatches over the command shell
    (``runtime_exec`` via ``engine._runtime_cli``) against the role's WIRED runtime
    ARN, reads back the artifact the CLI wrote, and the gate grades THAT file. A
    role with no wired runtime fails loud; there is no local fallback.

The executor is selected at startup from ``WORKSHOP_EXECUTOR`` (default / ``""`` /
``agentcore`` -> ``AgentCoreExecutor``; unknown values fail loud). Deterministic
OFFLINE TESTS inject a test-only ``FixtureExecutor`` (``fixture_executor.py``) by
constructor: it runs the role closures in-process and routes the PRODUCE step to
the deterministic builders (no model, no live AWS), so the gate / reviewer / compose
/ PR tail is exercised without a deployed runtime. No env flag selects a fake on the
shipped binary, and no shipped module imports the fixture.

Run it (always via the HTTP shell, ``connection_api.py``):
    python3 orchestrator/connection_api.py
