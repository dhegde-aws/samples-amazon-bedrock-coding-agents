# Configure the Codex frontend builder

Codex builds the thin chatbot UI. Claude Code builds the MCP backend and the Claude Code
validator validates the composed result. There is no race and no winner.

## Prerequisites

- `coding-agents/infra.config` exists.
- `openai.gpt-5.5` is enabled for Bedrock Mantle in `us-east-2`.
- The Runtime execution role can use the AWS SDK credential chain.
- Docker Buildx or Finch can build arm64 images.

Codex does not need an OpenAI key, AgentCore workload identity, or API-key
credential provider. The Runtime IAM role is the authentication path.

## Deploy

```bash
cd coding-agents/codex
./setup.sh
python deploy.py
```

`runtime_config.json` must contain a Runtime ARN and the Runtime must reach
`READY` before continuing.

## Stage project guidance

Copy the whole project configuration so hidden settings are preserved:

```bash
cp -R orchestrator/harness/codex/. /mnt/s3files/
test -s /mnt/s3files/AGENTS.md
test -s /mnt/s3files/.codex/config.toml
```

The root `AGENTS.md` defines the frontend role and UI contract. The hidden
`.codex/config.toml` selects the `amazon-bedrock` provider and model.

## Verify

```bash
agentcore exec --it \
  --runtime "$(jq -r .runtime_arn coding-agents/codex/runtime_config.json)" \
  --region us-west-2
```

Inside the Runtime, run `/app/run.sh` and ask Codex to build `chatbot.html`.
Verify that the page sends an MCP tools/call request and contains no local price
table or pricing arithmetic. Do not claim completion until the file exists and
the acceptance tests pass.
