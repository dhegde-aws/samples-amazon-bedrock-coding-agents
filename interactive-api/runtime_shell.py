"""Runtime shell proxy: connects the browser terminal to a REAL AgentCore Runtime.

Instead of spawning a local bash and pretending, this module opens a WebSocket
shell to the deployed runtime via AgentCoreRuntimeClient.open_shell() and proxies
I/O between the browser (via SSE + POST) and the runtime's PTY.

Each agent (claude-code, opencode, kiro) gets connected to its WIRED runtime ARN.
If no ARN is wired, the connection fails loud.
